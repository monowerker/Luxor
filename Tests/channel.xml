         <description>Widower Michael Bluth has been working for his father's development company since he was a teenager manning the family's frozen banana stand, and he and his son George Michael have gone so far as to move into one of the company's model homes. So when his father George Sr. throws his retirement party on the family yacht, Michael expects that he will be announced as his father's successor. Instead, Michael gets two surprises: His mother is the new President, and his father is under investigation by the SEC. So Michael has to hold his wildly dysfunctional family together.</description>
